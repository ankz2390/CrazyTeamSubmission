Application: Check Machine characteristics

Version: 1.0

Author: Ankit Nair <apnair@ncsu.edu>

The submission contains two files CompRules.drl and Comp.java. CompRules.drl encodes all the desired rules. 

Being new to Drools I was unable to figure out some aspects of the code in the restricted amount of time available, most significantly how 
to connect the Decision rules to different objects. Thereby, all the rules do not get fired effectively for the machines. However I do believe
that I have made the decision tree and the rules appropriately. Please have a look at my source code. I would love to learn about how these
problems can be solved.
